This is my final project for my statistics class that involves the analysis of random Stranger Things episodes. I analyzed emotional tone, visual effects, romance, audio effects and plot with numerous variables. 

## **Instructions**
To use the script, open "price-raw data.R", that contains my code for my findings, and the "stfinal - sheet 2.csv"

## **Data**
The data collected for this project was done by a simple random sample, selecting 16 episodes from all four seasons with 4 episodes given to each group member to be analyzed. Data was accumulated by watching each selected episode taking notes of crying, presence of blood, fight scenes, the use of 11's powers, deaths, anger, happiness, humor, creatures appearance, music playing, how many times Will is mentioned, flashbacks, mention of D&D, content, and if the episode had a good or bad rating in each scene. Scenes were defined as a change in time or setting. 

## **Operationalization**
The concept of emotional tone was operationalized by measuring if someone was crying, yelling, smiling in an epsiode with a dummy variable, 1=yes and 0=no; as well as the measurement of comedic aspect with a discrete variable, that just being numeric. 

The concept of visual effects was operationalized by measuring if there was blood or a physical altercation in an episode with a dummy variable. 1=yes and 0=no; as well as measuring the amount of times 11 used her powers, when a death occured, or when a creature appeared in a scene with a discrete variable, that being numeric.

The concept of romance was operationalized by measuring the amount of times there was a kiss in a scene with a discrete variable, that being numeric. 

The concept of visual effects was operationalized by measuring if music was playing in a scene with a dummy variable. 1=yes and 0=no; as well as measuring how many times the name "Will" is said in a scene with a discrete variable, that being numeric. 

The last concept of plot was operationalized by measuring how many times there was a flashback or when D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) was mentioned with a discrete variable, that being numeric; as well as measuring if the scene is moving the plot along and if the episode has a good rating(above a 9 on IMDB) or a bad one(below 8 on IMDB) with a dummy variable, 1=yes and 0=no.
